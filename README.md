Version: 2.0 (2020-11-05)

This version of the Catalog of cCGs has been slightly revised, because some redshifts (~ 40 out of 6000 groups involved) have been incorrectly reused, see details in [Zheng & Shen (2021)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...911..105Z/abstract). As a result, 16 groups have been removed.
